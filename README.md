# **Sean’s Codex (2025)**

## **Purpose**

This repository is a **living technical archive**. Its goal is to move beyond "how-to" tutorials and capture the **underlying mechanics** of the technologies I use. It is a tool for reducing cognitive load—storing complex architectural mental models so I can focus on building.

## **The Documentation Standard**

When adding new notes, prioritize the **"Meat"**:

* **The "Why" over "How":** Don't just record syntax; record the engineering trade-offs.
* **The Mental Model:** Describe the underlying engine (e.g., the Virtual DOM, the PVM, or the JWT Signature).
* **Scaling Metrics:** Note the Big-O complexity and memory implications of the solution.

## **Core Pillars**

As this repository grows, files should generally fall into these architectural categories:

1. **Foundations:** Execution pipelines, memory management, and language internals.
2. **Identity & Security:** Statelessness, cryptographic standards, and auth lifecycles.
3. **UI Engineering:** Declarative patterns, rendering performance, and modern tooling.
4. **Backend & Systems:** Decoupling patterns (Signals), database integrity, and API design.

## **Quick Reference Cheat-Sheet**

* **New Entry?** Use the standardized engineering template to ensure depth.
* **Searching?** Use `GitHub File Finder` (Press `t`) to locate modules instantly.
* **Reviewing?** Look for the **Trade-off Tables** to refresh on why a specific pattern was chosen over another.

## **The Goal: Architectural Mastery**

> "Software engineering is what happens to programming when you add time and other programmers."

This repository is my insurance policy against time—a way to ensure that today's deep-dives remain accessible for tomorrow's challenges.
